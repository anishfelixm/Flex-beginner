# Flex-beginner

Flexbox gave us a ton of amazing new tools for laying out a web page. Some important starting techniques :
1. Use display: flex; to create a flex container.
2. Use justify-content to define the horizontal alignment of items.
3. Use align-items to define the vertical alignment of items.
4. Use flex-direction if you need columns instead of rows.
5. Use the row-reverse or column-reverse values to flip item order.
6. Use order to customize the order of individual elements.
7. Use align-self to vertically align individual items.
8. Use flex to create flexible boxes that can stretch and shrink.
